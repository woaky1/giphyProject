This is a Brooklyn 99 Gif generator I created as part of my classwork at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. It starts off with a set of '99 topic buttons you can choose to get gifs based on that topic. You can also add new topic buttons. It was a lot of fun figuring out the process of adding and deleting favorites. Check it out!
